This is my first `React` application which I created as a beginner in learning React framework. <br>
This application takes a valid **city name** and associate [ISO 3166 Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) as inputs and produces the following weather updates: <br> <br>

**Location**: *city, country-code* <br>
**Temperature**: *in celcius*, <br>
**Condition**: *Clear, Mist, etc.*, <br>
**Humidity**: *relative value in percentage*, <br>
**Wind**: *speed in kilometer per hour, direction in degree* <br> <br>



![Weather Updates](https://github.com/Nazarah/weather-app-byacat/blob/gh-pages/static/media/WeatherResult.png "Weather result fetched for a city.") <br> <br>



On leaving any field empty, the app returns the following alert message: *"Please enter name of the City and Country."* <br> <br>



![Alert Text](https://github.com/Nazarah/weather-app-byacat/blob/gh-pages/static/media/Alert.png "Alert text on empty input submission.") <br> <br>



I referred to this [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI&list=PL0YyRgsdKp0qCuba8CBZGMNx0ZhfE39kJ&index=2&t=0s) to start learning react.<br>
I used the following API to retrieve weather Data: [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) <br> <br>

### Usage

Clone the Master branch of this repository and run the app in development mode with `npm start` <br>
Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser <br> <br>

#### Next Update

I will create provision for user account, where a user will be able to save favorite city and can check weather conditions for multiple cities at a glance. <br> <br>


Thanks for taking interest in my project. <br>
Please feel free to add *improvement suggestions*, *bug* or *usability problems* as **issues** in this repository <br> <br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
