# weather-app-byacat

This is my first `React` application which I created as a beginner in learning React framework.

This application takes a valid **city name** and associate [ISO 3166 Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) as inputs and produces the following weather updates:

**Location**:,

**Temperature**: *in celcius*,

**Condition**: *Clear, Mist, etc.*,

**Humidity**: *relative value in percentage*,

**Wind**: *speed in kilometer per hour, direction in degree*



On leaving any field empty, the app returns the following alert message: **"Please enter name of the City and Country."**

I referred to this [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI&list=PL0YyRgsdKp0qCuba8CBZGMNx0ZhfE39kJ&index=2&t=0s) to start learning react.
I used the following API to retrieve weather Data: [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)

The `CSS` and the **background image** have been customized by me.
I used the GitCat as the mascot of the app.

#### Next Update

I will create provision for user account, where a user will be able to save favorite city and can check weather conditions for multiple cities at a glance.



Thanks for taking interest in my project. 
Please feel free to add *improvement suggestions*, *bug* or *usability problems* as **issues** in this repository
